## Vb FilePatcher\(updated\)


</div>

### Description

Ok this now has all sourcecodes even for the test project and i added more commenting aswell and also contains no compiled exe's!...

Example of how to create a file patcher.

Please for educational use only!

Read the ReadMe before starting the project.. Also if i get the vote's i will create a PatchFile creator which willfeature calulation of the offsets and areas needed to be patched, folder compare, and also addition of new files. Some what rather like an installation program with a wizard type of interface for deployment, making installation sizes alot smaller for Updates etc...Thanks and Please Enjoy! =)
